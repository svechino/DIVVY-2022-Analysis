# DIVVY Bike Trips Analysis
## Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for the analysis of DIVVY bike trips data. The project involves preprocessing the data, followed by visual analysis and exploration using Tableau.

The initial phase of the project focuses on preprocessing the DIVVY bike trips data to ensure data quality and consistency. This includes handling missing values, standardizing column names, cleaning station names, and addressing outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset. The preprocessing steps aim to provide a clean and reliable dataset for further analysis.

After the data preprocessing stage, the project shifts to Tableau, a powerful data visualization and analysis tool. Tableau enables interactive and intuitive visualizations that allow for in-depth exploration and understanding of the DIVVY bike trips data.

## The main areas of analysis in Tableau include:
- ***Mapping Stations:*** Visualize the distribution of DIVVY bike stations on maps, providing insights into station density, coverage areas, and popular bike rental locations. Seasonality Analysis: Explore the seasonal patterns and trends in DIVVY bike trips. Identify peak seasons, examine fluctuations in ridership throughout the year, and uncover any seasonal factors that influence bike usage.

- ***Customer Type Analysis:*** Analyze the customer segments within DIVVY bike trips data. Understand the distribution of customer types, such as subscribers and casual users, and uncover patterns or differences in their riding behavior and preferences.

- ***Bike Type Analysis:*** Investigate the usage patterns of different bike types within the DIVVY fleet. Analyze the popularity of electric bikes versus classic bikes, assess their availability across stations, and identify any variations in usage based on bike type.

By leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, this project aims to provide comprehensive visualizations and insights into the DIVVY bike trips data. The code and resources in this GitHub repository serve as a guide for the preprocessing steps and facilitate the exploration and analysis of the data using Tableau.

Whether you're interested in understanding bike usage patterns, optimizing station placements, or gaining insights into customer behavior, this project provides valuable visualizations and analysis to help you make data-driven decisions in the context of DIVVY bike trips.
